# classwms
CLASSWMS is a Graphical User Interface developed under MATLAB, to classify water masses using clustering analysis and KNN classifier, according to the process presented by (Ayoub BELATTMANIA et al 2023).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CLASSWMS has been meticulously crafted and rigorously tested to operate seamlessly across Windows versions 7, 8, 10, and 11, all in their 64-bit versions. 
> The utilization of the classwms source code mandates the presence of MATLAB R2021a version or higher. 
> The target system running the standalone application (executable file)  does not require a licensed copy of MATLAB. Nevertheless it requires the MATLAB Runtime installation [R2021a](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) to run the application.

> To experience its full potential and functionality, users are encouraged to verify that their system aligns with the aformentioned specifications.

> [!TIP]
> To use the tool, individuals can obtain the required files from [GitHub](https://github.com/AYOUBELATTMANIA/classwms.git).
> This pertains specifically to the source code, the standalone application and accompanying support materials, encompassing:
- A documentation file (**help_doc.pdf**) furnishing an overview of the tool, its functionalities and instances of usage. 
- Several data files (**data_to_classify.txt, database_not_labeled.txt, database_labeled.txt**), the description of which is elaborated upon in the documentation file.
- Several files (landareas.dbf, landareas.shp, landareas.shx) containing worldwide land areas information using in map plot.
